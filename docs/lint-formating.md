# Lint and formatting guide

To ensure code quality and consistency, this project uses ESLint for linting and Prettier for formatting.

## Running ESLint

ESLint is a tool for identifying and fixing problems in your JavaScript code. It enforces coding standards and helps catch potential errors.

To run ESLint:

```sh
npm run lint
```

## Formatting with Prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that ensures your code adheres to a consistent style, making it easier to read and maintain.

To format the code using Prettier:

```sh
npm run format
```
